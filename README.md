# zed
A visual editor to craft numerical stuff, targeted to both programmers
and non-programmers. How can we design an editor for programming tasks that
won't afraid non-programmers and that programmers (at least some of them) will
still find usable?

Check the [demo](http://nnodot.github.io/zed/app.html).

It is a quick and dirty proof of concept, numerous features are missing, some
are buggy, others will be removed, etc.
