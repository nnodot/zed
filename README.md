# zed
A visual editor for programming with javascript, targeted to both programmers
and non-programmers. How can we design an editor for programming tasks that
won't afraid non-programmers and that programmers will find usable?

Check the [demo](http://nnodot.github.io/zed/app.html).

It is a proof of concept, numerous features are missing, some are buggy, others
will be removed, etc.
